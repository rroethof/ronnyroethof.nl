      </ul>
      We chose for a KeepAlived, HAProxy, NGinx setup based upon a cluster of KVM nodes.
      The backend servers all used memcached and imapproxy.
      Outgoing filtering was done by Postfix with Amavisd, Spamassassin, ClamAV, etc, with a failover configuration.
      We designed the platform in a matter that we could take a physical node, shut it down for maintenance en have no customer impact whatsover.
